Quantum circuit solver

I did not get as much done as I wanted to but this application will draw circuits that you give in the form of QASM 2.0. You can you your console.log functionality to view the results of running the circuit. This was a big challenge for me, as someone who does not have a lot of website design experience but it was a great experience none the less. I would like to continue to improve this application to be more responsive and have more intuitive UI controls for editing the circuit.

Currently the only way to edit the circuit is by pasting QASM compliant code into the circuit. Please take a look at https://github.com/Qiskit/openqasm/tree/master/examples. Just download some of those files and paste in the content to see it work.
